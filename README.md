# GraphQL experiment

### What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a data query language developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015. It provides an alternate to REST and ad-hoc webservice architectures.

### Personal goals
- To create, collect and configure pacakges needed to build an API using GraphQL and NodeJS.
- To make it easy-to-use for Webpack, React & Redux based single page applications.
- To add an extra layer of security for private endpoints. 
- To consider using the app on distributed systems.
